* Templates, metaprogramming, SNIFAE, constexprs, etc. are love
    * Try `constexpr` before reaching for `#define`
* New C++ features are love
    * Especially if they're custom reimplementations of standard library stuff
* If it builds and `printf` in `kmain()` looks alright, ship it!
    * Tests are nice but whatever, can't run them without using GCC 9 as the system compiler anyway (yolo)
